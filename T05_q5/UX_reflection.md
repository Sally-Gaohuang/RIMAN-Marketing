🧠 Psychology

Ask Yourself: “What is the user’s motivation to be here in the first place?”

Answer:
Users (such as recruiters or professors) visit my portfolio to quickly understand my background and skills.
Therefore I placed my name and key role at the top and kept the layout clean and calm to reduce cognitive load.

🖱️ Usability

Ask Yourself: “Could you get the job done with less input from the user?”

Answer:
Yes. The page has a simple scroll navigation and does not require any login or clicks to view content.
Each section has clear headings so users can find education or experience within seconds.

🎨 Design

Ask Yourself: “Does the design lead the user’s eyes to the right places?”

Answer:
Yes. The header uses a blue accent to draw attention first to my name, then section titles use consistent color hierarchy (h2).
Whitespace separates sections, making the page easy to scan on desktop and mobile.

✍️ Copywriting

Ask Yourself: “Is the biggest text the most important text?”

Answer:
Yes. My name (h1) is largest, followed by section headings.
All text is clear and concise—no marketing phrases—so users can absorb information quickly.

📊 Analysis

Ask Yourself: “How will you measure this?”

Answer:
If published online, I would use basic analytics (e.g., GitHub Pages view counts or Google Analytics) to see which sections are most visited and adjust layout based on user behaviour and scroll depth.
