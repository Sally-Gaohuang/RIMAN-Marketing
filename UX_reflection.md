#  UX Reflection and Improved Wireframe

---

## 🧠 Psychology

**Ask Yourself:** “What is the user’s motivation to be here in the first place?”

**Answer:**  
In the original design, users (such as recruiters or professors) visited my portfolio to quickly understand my background and skills.  
In this updated version, the page also serves **a marketing purpose** — helping visitors (potential partners or customers) connect with **Ms Amanda**, a professional beauty consultant recruiting new partners.  
Therefore, the design emphasizes **clarity, warmth, and trust** through soft colors, approachable tone, and visible contact calls-to-action (QR codes).

## 🖱️ Usability

**Ask Yourself:** “Could the user get what they need with minimal effort?”  

**Answer:**  
Yes.  
For Amanda’s recruitment advertisement, visitors can understand the message **without scrolling too much**.  
The QR codes for **WeChat and WhatsApp** are directly visible, so users can **contact instantly** without navigating to another page.  
Every important element — name, tagline, and call-to-action — appears **above the fold** (visible immediately upon loading).

## 🎨 Design

**Ask Yourself:** “Does the design guide the user’s focus naturally?”  

**Answer:**  
Yes.  
The light **pink and gold tones** create a premium yet friendly feel that matches the beauty and wellness industry.  
Soft gradients and diamond sparkles subtly draw the eye toward the advertisement center.  
Clear text hierarchy ensures that the **headline, description, and contact buttons** stand out.  
On mobile, layout stacks vertically to remain legible and attractive.

## ✍️ Copywriting

**Ask Yourself:** “Is the most important text the most noticeable?”  

**Answer:**  
Yes.  
The headline (“✨ RIMAN 团队招募合作伙伴 ✨”) is large, emotional, and encouraging.  
Key benefits — like **创业辅导**, **培训支持**, and **团队合作** — are placed in bullet form for quick scanning.  
The call-to-action button (“📞 联系 Ms Amanda 了解更多”) is visually distinct and reinforces the purpose of the page.

## 📊 Analysis

**Ask Yourself:** “How will you measure this design’s success?”  

**Answer:**  
If hosted on **GitHub Pages**, performance can be tracked through:
- View count analytics (traffic data)
- User behavior analysis (scroll depth, QR interactions)
- Conversion rate (how many users contact via QR codes)

This feedback would guide future improvements — such as refining messaging or testing button color for higher engagement.
